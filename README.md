# TicTacToe-GameInJava
  Basic Java Application which used  conditionals, loops, and functions!<br><br>
  After asking us for our names, the program prints out a 3x3 board filled with dashes, signifying empty spots.
Each turn it asks either player 1 or player 2 to enter a row and col index which is where they want to place their x and o, and then the board is printed again with the x or o in the right spot.
If the position the player entered is “off the board” or already has an x or o on it, then our program notifies the player, who is prompted to enter another row and col.
Once the player wins by getting 3 in a row, column, or diagonal, the program prints that player 1 or 2 has won and prints out the final board.
